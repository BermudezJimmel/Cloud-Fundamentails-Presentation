# Module 1: AWS Organizations & Multi-Account Strategy
**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Level:** Cloud Practitioner

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what AWS Organizations is and why it's needed
- Know the benefits of multi-account architecture
- Be able to design account structures for TESDA

## 📖 What is AWS Organizations?

### Simple Definition
AWS Organizations is like having a "master control panel" for multiple AWS accounts. Think of it as managing multiple bank accounts from one central dashboard.

### Why Do We Need Multiple AWS Accounts?
- **Separation:** Keep production systems separate from testing
- **Security:** If one account gets compromised, others remain safe
- **Cost Control:** Track spending per department/project
- **Compliance:** Meet government requirements for data isolation

## 🏢 AWS Organizations Benefits

### Centralized Billing
- One bill for all accounts (like a family phone plan)
- Volume discounts across all accounts
- Simplified payment management

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Set rules for what each account can do
- Prevent accidental or malicious actions
- Enforce compliance requirements

### Account Isolation
- Each account is completely separate
- Security boundaries between environments
- Independent resource limits

### Resource Sharing
- Share common services across accounts
- Centralized DNS and directory services
- Shared networking components

## 🏗️ Multi-Account Architecture for TESDA

### Recommended Structure
```
TESDA Main Organization
├── Security Account (All logs and monitoring)
├── Production Account (Live LMS for students)
├── Staging Account (Testing new features)
├── Development Account (Developers work here)
└── Shared Services Account (Common tools like DNS)
```

### Key Concepts Explained

#### Root Account
- The main account that controls everything
- Should only be used for billing and organization management
- Requires strongest security measures

#### Member Accounts
- Individual accounts for different purposes
- Isolated from each other
- Managed through the root account

#### Organizational Units (OUs)
- Groups of accounts (like folders)
- Apply policies to multiple accounts at once
- Organize by function, environment, or department

## 🎯 TESDA Context

### Separation Benefits
- **Different Programs:** Separate accounts for different TESDA programs
- **Environment Isolation:** Development, testing, and production separation
- **Department Boundaries:** Each department has its own resources

### Compliance Benefits
- **Data Isolation:** Student data separated by program
- **Audit Requirements:** Clear boundaries for compliance
- **Access Control:** Department-specific access management

### Cost Benefits
- **Department Tracking:** See exactly what each department spends
- **Project Allocation:** Track costs per training program
- **Budget Controls:** Set spending limits per account

## 🔍 Real-World Example

When TESDA implements this structure:
1. **Curriculum Development** team works in Development Account
2. **IT Operations** manages Production Account
3. **Security Team** monitors from Security Account
4. **Finance** sees consolidated billing from Root Account
5. **Students** access systems in Production Account only

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- AWS Organizations provides centralized management
- Multi-account strategy improves security and compliance
- Proper account structure supports TESDA's organizational needs
- Billing consolidation provides cost benefits

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with a simple structure and add accounts as needed. It's easier to add accounts than to reorganize later.
